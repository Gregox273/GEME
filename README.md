# GEME
CUES Hackathon 2017

## Code outline

-Inputs: csv datasets (e.g. "1973-10",791 )

For each pair of datasets:
-Store in program or just read line by line from csv?
-Select data range to compare
-Calculate correlation and significance
-For correlation (and significance) greater than threshold, print result and graph
-

Optimisations?:
-Do rough/quick correlation to decide which pairs to investigate further?
