# GEME
CUES Hackathon 2017

## Code outline

- Inputs: csv datasets (e.g. "1973-10",791 )

- For each pair of datasets:
- Store in program or just read line by line from csv?
- Convert data to standardised format?
- Select data range to compare
- Calculate correlation and significance
- For correlation (and significance) greater than threshold, print result and graph

## Optimisations/upgrade?:
- Do rough/quick correlation to decide which pairs to investigate further?
- Correlate spatial data (we haven't found any sources yet...)
